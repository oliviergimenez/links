As a publication committed to explaining statistical ideas and concepts, we want to help readers understand what’s going on, to make sense of the data they are confronted with, and to put important information into the appropriate context.

The main focus is on compartmental rather than agent- (or network-)based models, and on more complex/realistic (i.e. including age/spatial structure, compartments for asymptomatic, hospitalized, ICU, ventilator ...) scenarios. (Basic implementations of the deterministic S(E)IR, e.g. "flatten the curve" demos, are out of scope.) Several of the models listed here are also included in the Software Tools/Modeling section of the [MIDAS COVID repo](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/tree/master/software_tools)
